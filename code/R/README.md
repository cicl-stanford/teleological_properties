Data analyses and figures were generated using the script in `teleological_properties.Rmd`. `cache` contains the bayesian models that were run for experiments 2, 3 and 4. To reproduce all analyses and figures, simply fork the repository, open `teleological_properties.Rproj` in RStudio, load `tteleological_properties.Rmd` and click `run all`.
